# Ludum-Dare-2017

Forlorn was my submission to the Finally Finish Something Game Jam. It's a continuation to an idea I had for the previous Ludum Dare but never finished. In Forlorn, you are a stranded astronaut on an alien world. You must collect fuel for your ship so you can leave, but the wildlife here is dangerous, and the more fuel you have the more aggressive they become. Be careful and you just might make it out alive.
